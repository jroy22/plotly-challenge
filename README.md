This is a challenge using Plot.ly on JavaScript for Data Visualization and Analytics Bootcamp - University of Minnesota Twin Cities

## Plot.ly

This assignment creates an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset that catalogs microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species, Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rar.

### Dashboard

The dashboard is made up of 4 figures a bar graph, gauge chart, demographic table and a bubble chart. Each figure updates with every selection of a Subject's ID Number. 

- Bar Graph:  Displays the Top 10 OTUs found in a particular Subject
- Gauge Chart: Displays the frequency a particular Subject washes their navel
- Demographic Table: Displays the demographic information of the Subject including: Id #, Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Location
- Bubble Chart: Visualizes the number and amount of OTUs are present in a particular Subject
